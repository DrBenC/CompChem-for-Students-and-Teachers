ORCA COMMANDS FOR USE IN COMMAND LINE

--------------------------------

Ensure that you have used the 'cd' command to move to the directory where you have saved the .xyz and .inp files, e.g.

"cd C:\MyDirectory\MySubDirectory\"

(Note that these files are needed by a standard ORCA calculation as explained in Episode 2)

"orca file.inp>file.out"

To set off the experiment.

--------------------------------

After running the ORCA calculation, use

"orca_mapspc file.out IR -x0400 -x14500"

To generate an infrared spectrum (.dat format) of the molecule as described in the .out file. 
-x0 defines the lower wavenumber range limit and -x1 defines the upper: the above command will generate
an infrared spectrum from the x-range of 400-4500 wavenumbers.

--------------------------------

To plot the molecular vibrations:

"orca_pltvib file.hess all"

Will generate a series of .xyz files based on all molecular vibrations listed in the .out file. 
To see which vibrational frequencies these modes correspond to, check the 'VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES' section of the .out file.
