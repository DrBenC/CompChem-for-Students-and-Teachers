ORCA COMMANDS FOR USE IN COMMAND LINE

--------------------------------

Ensure that you have used the 'cd' command to move to the directory where you have saved the .out and .hess files, e.g.

"cd C:\MyDirectory\MySubDirectory\"

(Note that these files are generated by a standard ORCA calculation as explained in Episode 2)

--------------------------------

To plot the molecular vibrations:

"orca_pltvib water.hess all"

Will generate a series of .xyz files based on all molecular vibrations listed in the .out file. 
To see which vibrational frequencies these modes correspond to, check the 'VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES' section of the .out file.
